-   What is conditional rendering?
    > rendering on the condition of something happening, examples being if this variable is 1 instead of 0 then a component will be rendered, shit like that
-   How do you implement conditional rendering?
    > put out a condition, then have a way for that variable to change, like the time of day, or the season, or the simple change of a number in the website. Then have that condition be the requirement to render something out, like a simple component being rendered IF the season is autumn or smth like that
-   WHich method of conditional rendering do you prefer to use?
    > anything works aslong as it's good, I don't prefer one over the other, but for me the most reliable are if statements, and array loops, but if the situation calls for it I will use something else
